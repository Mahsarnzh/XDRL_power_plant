# XAI_Nuc

The provided code is a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm trained to assist in decision-making for predictive maintenance in a power plant. The networks in this project have been trained in MATLAB, and the code for training the actor and critic networks is not provided. However, the trained agent is uploaded using ONNX. Subsequently, SHAP, an eXplainable AI (XAI) tool, has been applied to explain the decisions made by the agent.

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Download the `XDRL_SHAP_Actor_Critic_POMDP.ipynb` file.**
2. **Upload the notebook to Google Colab.**
3. **Run all cells in the notebook.**

The `XDRL_SHAP_Actor_Critic_POMDP.ipynb` file provides insights into the inner workings of the trained Neural Networks using SHAP, an eXplainable AI tool. This notebook serves as a valuable resource for understanding and interpreting the decisions made by the trained agent.

Feel free to explore and gain insights into the explainability of the model!
